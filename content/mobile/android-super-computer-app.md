Did you ever wish you had a super computer in your pocket? You know for
those debates at the firehouse; "Dude, I guarantee the human genome is
completely indexable with the touch of a button, guarantee!"

Thanks to the geniuses at MIT, you could potentially deliver on such a
promise. The [rbAPPmit][] has serious muscle behind the funny little
green fella.
