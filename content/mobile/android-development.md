Title: Android Development

I just completed started my first Android app. It works... and its damn
cool to see something you built on *your* phone. That said, there is
still a *TON* of work to do. I hope that I'm not served with a [cease
and desist][] order, as Oracle is suing Google for patent infringements
relating to Android development. Although, I once read if you're not
getting in trouble you're not trying hard enough... perhaps?

Back to the app, its a fire department related app and the only
competition retails his app at \$2.99. I've been thinking all along that
I will release free apps as long as I have a decent job and my family is
not wanting for anything. I believe in karma and as such,
I definitely don't want to be greedy (especially as so many people are
struggling to make ends meet in the current economic environment).  Not
to say this app cures cancer or something, but I imagine the other
developer may not like a free app similar to his... I don't know
anything about developer decorum in such circumstances.

I'll have more very soon... STAY TUNED!
