Title: Lab - Twitter Bootstrap V2
Date: 2012-02-09

The awesome duo, @mdo && @fat, of [Twitter bootstrap][] fame have
released [Twitter bootstrap][] 2.0. In short, [Twitter bootstrap][] is a
great way to get HTML5-CSS3-JavaScript up and running with a lot of the
hard work already done.

The project comes with a heap of customization options and a full
complement of Less files which compile down to CSS. If you haven't
checked out [Less][], you really ought to as it makes CSS dev much
saner.

I have set-up a lab page for experiments, tests,
projects-that-are-not-quite-done and my foray into game development. The
Caffeine lab is built with [Twitter bootstrap][] and is definitely a
work in progress. The lab stuff will be in the lab link in the header.
