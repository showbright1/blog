Title: LocalStorage with Knockout.js - jQuery Mobile - jStorage

I recently started evaluating various JS libraries/frameworks and other
JavaScript goodies. I just wanted to post a quick tutorial when working
with Phonegap (Cordova)Â [jQuery Mobile][] and [Knockout.js][].

This project uses;

1.  [Cordova][]
2.  [jQuery Mobile][]
3.  [Knockout.js][1]
4.  [jStorage][]

</p>

Set a binding to a click event on the view model you want to save:

    :::javascript
    /* GLOBAL VAR & CLICK HANDLER/FUNCTION TO STORE ViewModel */
    var viewSaveID;
    function saveThisViewModel() {
        // check to see if jStorage has items
        // if not, assign 0 to key otherwise assign count number 
    // as items are save chronologically and not overwritten
        if ($.jStorage.index().length) === 0) {
            viewSaveID = 0;
        }
        viewSaveID = $.jStorage.index().length;
        // increment counter for key to localStorage
        viewSaveID = viewSaveID + 1;
        // Set data to JS format could also be ko.toJSON for a JSON object
        var data = ko.toJS(myViewModel);
        // on the dollar save via jStorage
        $.jStorage.set(viewSaveID, data);
        // return true to keep default behavior in app
        return true;
    }

Next I would like to show you how we get the data. Although this
implementation looks incredibly simple, I went through a bunch of
implementations to arrive at this:

    :::javascript
    /* Get Data From Storage and save it to Array */
    function getDataStore() {
    // assign the keys of the jStorage index to an observable array
        myViewModel.myDataStoreIndex($.jStorage.index());

    // check to see if there are items in the data store array
    // if yes, remove them 
        if (myViewModel.myDataStore().length > 0) {
    // This may not scale well, but for localStorage, we don't need it too.
    // the problem is overwriting and double entries, this little diddy solves both
            myViewModel.myDataStore.removeAll();
            console.log("removeAll fired")
        }
        //create a temp object to hold objects that are saved in storage
        var savedData = {};
    // iterate through the array of keys
        for (var i = 0; i < myViewModel.myDataStoreIndex().length; i++) {
    // pull the objects from storage based on the keys stored in the array
            savedData = $.jStorage.get(myViewModel.myDataStoreIndex()[i]);
    // push the saved object to the observable array
            myViewModel.myDataStore.push(savedData);
            console.log("Data has been pushed to vacDataStore " + i + " times.");
    // when you iterate on a list view item in jQuery Mobile 
    // you have refresh the list. Otherwise it displays incorrectly
            $('#myListView').listview('refresh');
        }
    }

Now all you need to do is work with the data in the myDataStore
Observable array. I choose to iterate the objects into a list using the
convient foreach and a template. The code is commented and should be
self explanatory. If you have issues or need further clarification don't
hesitate to comment. I will post the full app soon!
