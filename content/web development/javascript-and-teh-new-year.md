Amazing.

It is really quite amazing what you can get accomplished with Javascript
once you wrap mind around its subtleties. I am there. I'm launching
something quite new in the next week or so.... a sort of repository.

I will have my very own LABS page in the coming days. I will post
demo's, odds & ends there with full descriptions and tutorials here.
Keep your eyes peeled.

The apps/market playground is quite fun and I'm not done there yet. The
inevitable consolidation of the various app markets is underway, and the
great migration to the next *wild west* is taking place once again.

The beauty in this consolidation is that it always lags and never fails
to not materialize ( ? double negative === falsy : sue me :) )... except
in one arena: teh internetz.

( My Dad told me to never use always, and to always remember that).

So where is the next gold rush? Who knows! Who cares? I'm having so much
fun playing with the power of Javascript that I could care less. I just
want to be "better" and that is all I'm working on right now, in
multiple avenues.

In any case, its late and I've been pounding away on a cool
cross-platform application (TBA soon). See you next year!
