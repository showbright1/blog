So I've been playing around with [node.js][] a bit. I dig it basically
because I dig Javascript. Node is one of those disruptive technologies
that people either love or hate... or ironically both. You program to
async patterns for E\_V\_E\_R\_Y\_T\_H\_I\_N\_G, and I mean everything.
Procedural code will break stuff and break it badly.

One of the strengths of node.js is the ability to write super fast
command-line applications. I have a several that are complete messes at
this point, but I am cleaning them up to be presentable on Github... So
I can't, in good conscience leave you with no "demo"... so here is the
monk lab page, written with the [Express][] framework and hosted by the
awesome dudes at [Nodejitsu][].
