Title: Abecedario Infantil

Abecedario Infantil is an application that will teach you or your child
the alphabet in Spanish in a fun and interactive way.

The Letras y Sonidos(letters & sounds)button will show you the correct
pronunciation of the letter, it is audible when the letter card is
loaded. If you miss the sound, simply touch the card and it will play
again. This screen also includes a picture of an object or animal with
the corresponding name in Spanish. In a future version, the card will
also play those words.

The Signos (Signs) button will teach the basic sign language alphabet.

We are working on more interactive Spanish/English activities, so please
stay tuned.

A bit of advice if I may: My three year old (ver 1.0) likes to touch the
card, what seems like a thousand times, before moving on the the next
letter. Adjust volume controls as necessary.

My wife is from Colombia and speaks nothing but Spanish to our children.
A spectacular consequence is the ability of my children (1.0 only, as
2.0 is still too young to speak) to switch between English and Spanish
effortlessly. What we found amazing is that while 1.0 speaks Spanish, he
really didn't know the alphabet. This app has really changed that and
1.0 know knows his Spanish alphabet as well as the English alphabet.
