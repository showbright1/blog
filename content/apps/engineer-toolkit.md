Engineer Toolkit
================

</p>
My math teacher always told me to learn how to calculate formulas and
such manually because I may not have a calculator to rely on. She was
right and no one should rely 100% on a tool other than one's mind
coupled with training and practice. That said, My math teach and I were
not aware of the computing power that is riding around in most of our
pockets 24/7 these days.

The **Engineer Toolki**t is the first comprehensive Android tool for
Engineers / Drivers / Pump operators. It will also prove helpful for
fill-ins or anyone else that may need to calculate on the fireground.
Quick , accurate and intuitive design and implementation objectives were
strictly adhered to during design and construction.

Quick data entry is paramount when determining what to pump on scene.
Input on mobile devices can be tedious and sometimes difficult when
forwarding the latest joke to your crew. Now imagine typing all the hose
lengths, various flows and nozzle pressures when your at the "big one"!
You can't delay and recalling rote memorized hydraulic formulas can be
difficult at 3am . This app requires ZERO manual input of values to get
pump discharge pressure (PDP) and friction loss (FL) of complex hose
lays and scenarios .

Most of the app is structured in a step-by-step fashion leading to the
eventual calculated data, I.e. PDP, FL, etc.  It was designed to be
intuitive and easy to use. If you find areas that can be improved or
fixed, please don't hesitate to email, call, send smoke signals or call
911 (Stranger things have happened, eh?). In all seriousness, I'm
serious about helping Engineers perform on the fireground... I'm
thinking up some kind of reward program for helpful suggestions and
comments.
