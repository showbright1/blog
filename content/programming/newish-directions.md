"Native" development is fun and challenging, but (there is always a but)
I find myself wanting to embrace a wider audience. The rumors you hear
about making money with Android may or may not be true. I have two apps
out; one is paid and one is free.

My apps are completely different and 100% un-related from each other.
That said, the free app has been downloaded almost an order of magnitude
more than the paid app. I'm not sure if that means a damn thing, but its
hard to miss. The quality of my apps and usefulness aside; its also
difficult to look at the other platforms and not have a, "What if my app
was in that store..." moment.

So I'm currently investigating ways to get my apps cross-platform and
its been an extremely fun process. I've looked at;
Flash/Flex/Air/JavaScript/HTML/CSS/Phonegap/Titanium/... and so on. I
will be posting a nice big roundup here shortly. I'm still gathering
materials/evidence as I don't want to alienate or mislead other people
who are curious for the same info and another perspective.
