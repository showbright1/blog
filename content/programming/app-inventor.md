[Google's App Inventor Beta](http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/about/) is an AWESOME program and I'm lucky to be
a part of it. They say it is intended for non-programmers and I agree to
 a certain extent. However, people with programming experience will be
quickly making apps that *work*.

Anecdotal evidence, my own, from the Google AI discussion board suggests
that people with no programming experience **struggle**. They struggle
with anything outside of hat was shown them in the[tutorials]( http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/learn/tutorials/index.html). The
good news is the tutorials are quite comprehensive... the bad news is
the tutorials don't cover a LOT of material.

The documentation is decent, but lacks depth in many areas. As this beta
progresses, I'm sure we'll see more in the form of documentation...
among other improvements.

Stay tuned for the apps I'm working on, as I'll post them as they are
complete and ready for download. Cheers.
