Title: Bloging with Pelican

## New Year, New Domain ##
I am migrating away from caffeineindustries and if you are a reader, you will have surely noticed the redirection here. 
The reasons for this migration are several fold. I will enumerate a few of them here. 

Numero uno, I have been spending quite a bit of time in school. This leaves very little time for other (generally more fun)
activities. So I take lots of notes for school and gave up on [Evernote](http://evernote.com). I have almost completely switched
to emacs for my day-to-day text based activities. That includes note, code and love letters to my wife. [Org-mode](http://orgmode.org)
has basically changed the way I write my life. This should actually be a seperate post.

Spending so much time in emacs has allowed me to write everything down in plain text. I can then convert this to a plethora of formats, 
many of which are suitable for the web. There is even an org-mode plugin that facilitates org-mode files to wordpress blogs. Wordpress is 
great and I don't have many complaints with it. However, I have always struggled to get exactly what I want without diving into PHP.

I don't want to learn PHP right now. There are a lot of people who say a lot of NOT nice things about PHP. I haven't really worked with 
it so I will reserve judgment here. I will say that I am trying to really learn Python... SO I found a python static site generator to 
build this site and hack on here and there. 

In the end change is something that I am confortable with (thank goodness as this world moves fast). I hope to add a bunch of cool science-y 
web experiments in the lab section. The notes section is for all my personal notes for study and reminders and general brain-dumps. 

## Now Powered by Pelican ##
This blog and website is now powered by the great [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) static site generator.
The documentation for the engine is quite good and didn't require much googling. If you are familiar with 
Pelican, you have surely noticed that this is a custom theme. I will clean it up a bit and release it in 
due time. More on Pelican in a future post...
