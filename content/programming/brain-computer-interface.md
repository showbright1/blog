WOW.

Talk about a fun diversion. I was minding my own business reading
through my emails and I came across this [hardware hacker manifesto][].
I've been taking things apart and *trying* to put them back together,
sometimes in different configurations, for a looooonnnnggg time. Most
people label this as a curious diversion or nerdy escapade if you
explain it in context. I've never really thought to label it
as*Hacking*... until I became a subscriber to [Make:][]. I don't really
have an opinion as to the manifesto above, as its none of my business
really... However, I became instantly and extremely interested in what
this guy was hacking.

The item is called the[Emotiv EPOC headset][] and it looks AWESOME. Why?
Its a research
grade **[Electroencephalography][]**[(][Electroencephalography]**[EEG][Electroencephalography]**[)][Electroencephalography]
device at a consumer price point that ships with a relatively low cost
software development kit and a suite of tools that are plug and play. 
This is the FUTURE as far as I'm concerned. Again, you may ask, why?
Not only does it represent the ultimate in laziness (Humans do love to
be lazy... just ask them), it represents the possibility of truly
understanding the human condition.

The brain. Our brain is an amazing feat of biological engineering. As I
sit here and struggle for words to tap into the keyboard so they can be
suitable for displaying and conveying my thoughts and emotion... I
wonder if this is how humans are to really designed to communicate. Does
the written word represent the path of least resistance to enable
communication of human thoughts and emotion in a static medium? Is there
another way? A billion similar question
and convoluted pseudo-philosophical arguments rage in my little noodle.

At this point, I'm not 100% sure what this headset is really *capable
of*. I've watched a handful of YouTube videos and read a white paper or
two and I'm really just getting to the meat of it. One thing is for
sure, I know what I want for Christmas.
