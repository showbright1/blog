Title: AS3 MadComponents Tutorial Series - Starting Out
Date: 2011-09-02
Author: Michael


[MadComponents][] is an AWESOME ActionScript 3 library for mobile UI
design and App development. It is really lightweight, fast and doesn't
use any of the FLEX framework\*. MadComponents provides all the tools to
make really nice functional mobile apps with Flash. One can choose to
use pure ActionScript or use a combination of AS3 and XML. The XML
implementation with MadComponents provides a clean method to populate
and define the UI. If one comes from a background in Android development
this will look very logical.

Daniel Freeman, the library author, has a nice collection of tutorials
on his blog: http://madskool.wordpress.com/ I'll list them in this post
and attempt to extend them in subsequent posts.

\*I'm no zealot, but my experience with Flex on mobile has been a bit
troubling. Number one, it is an extremely large library and has a lot of
reported performance issues. I'm sure performance will get better as
time goes on, as Adobe is working hard to fix this. Number two, MXML
compiles down to AS3... so my thought is why waste time with MXML and
just use AS3 from the onset, especially when Adobe asks you to code
certain aspects (item renders) in AS3 anyway.
