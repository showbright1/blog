After searching high and low for a set of Android Holographic UI
elements for mockups and coming up empty.... I decided to create one. It
is very, very much a work in progress, but I thought I'd get it out
there and see what happens. Help spread the word!!!

All of the elements are grouped in sub-layers for Fireworks. The
Photoshop file is also organized in layers. Both files are vectors and
fully editable. Let me know if you'd like to see something, changes,
etc.
